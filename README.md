**.screenrc** | Make the screen program fancier
**01-serverid** | Add to /etc/update-motd.d to display some info about your server on login
**fail2banstatusall** | Show status of all fail2ban jails 
**backup** | Encrypted incremental backups using duplicity, some config required, see script comments. Add to daily cron and set it and forget it
